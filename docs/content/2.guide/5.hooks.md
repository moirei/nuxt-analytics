# Hooks

Hooks can be used to tap into Nuxt Analytics lifecycle. A hook callback can modify event payload (globally) or signal the event to be completely discarded.

When a _before_ hook returns `false`, its event is discarded.

```ts
const { on } = useAnalytics();

on("track:before", (payload) => {
  if (shouldDiscard(payload)) {
    return false;
  }
});
```

Hooks can directly modify a payload or return a completely new payload data:

```ts
on("track:before", (payload) => {
  if (payload.event == EcommerceEvent.AddToCart) {
    payload.props.source = "My Site";
  }else  if (payload.event == EcommerceEvent.ProgressCheckout) {
    return {
      ...payload,
      props: {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
});
```
