# Event adapters

Adapters provide the flexibility to further define how _Named Events_ are renamed and/or formatted per channel.

For example, a `Add to Cart` event is named `AddToCart` for Facebook Pixel, `add_to_cart` for Google Analytics and maybe `Added to Cart` for Mixpanel. With adapters, you define named events and then their names and payload properties are automatically formatted before sending to channels.

```ts
export default defineAppConfig({
  analytics: {
    adapters: ["facebook", "ga"],
  },
});
```

Two inbuilt adapters, `facebook` and `ga` are supplied for common E-commerce events. You are free to extend or use your own adapters.

## Custom adapters

Define your named events (Recommended):

```ts [MyEvents.ts]
export enum AppEvents {
  Event1 = "event-1",
}
```

Define your custom adapter:

```ts [MyCustomAdapter.ts]
export class MyCustomAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
  // Optional. Only apply to select channels
  protected $channels = ["my-channel"];

  /**
   * Configure adapter
   */
  public configure() {
    this.mapEventName(AppEvents.Event1, "My Renamed Event to `my-channel`");

    ...
  }
}
```

Register adapter:

```ts
export default defineAppConfig({
  analytics: {
    adapters: ["facebook", "ga", MyCustomAdapter],
  },
});
```

## Inline adapters

```ts
import { defineAdapter } from "@moirei/nuxt-analytics";

export default defineAppConfig({
  analytics: {
    ...
    adapters: [
      "ga",
      "facebook",
      defineAdapter({
        channels: ["debug"],
        events: [ElementEvent.Clicked, ElementEvent.Seen],
        mapEventNames: {
          [ElementEvent.Clicked]: "Debugged: Item Clicked",
          [ElementEvent.Seen](payload) {
            return "Debugged: " + payload.event;
          },
        },
        ...
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```
